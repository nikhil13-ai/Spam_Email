# Spam Email Classifier

# Project Description
This project implements a Spam Email Classifier using machine learning algorithms. The goal of the project is to build a system that automatically distinguishes between spam and non-spam (ham) emails. The classifier can help improve inbox security and reduce unwanted emails.

# Dataset
The dataset contains two types of email messages: spam and ham (legitimate emails). Each email is labeled accordingly, and the dataset includes various features that represent the content of each email, such as:

Word frequencies
Presence of special characters (e.g., $, !)
Length of the subject line
HTML tags
Popular datasets include the Enron Email Dataset or publicly available spam datasets.

# Workflow
Data Preprocessing: The emails are cleaned and preprocessed by removing stop words, special characters, and other unnecessary content. Text vectorization techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF are used to convert the emails into numerical representations.

Model Training: Several machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) are trained to classify emails as either spam or ham.

Model Evaluation: The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Cross-validation is used to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

# Technologies Used
Python: For building the classifier
Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models
Pandas & NumPy: For handling and preprocessing data
NLTK or SpaCy: For natural language processing tasks
Matplotlib: For visualizing model performance

# Results
The spam classifier effectively identifies and filters out spam emails, achieving high accuracy and precision. It can be integrated into an email client to filter incoming emails and move spam emails to a designated folder.
